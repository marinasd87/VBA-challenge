# VBA-challenge
For this week's challenge, I've created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
  
  * The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
  
Runing the macro call allSheets, will run the script through all the sheets/years in the spreadsheet.
